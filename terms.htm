<h2>4. Projects</h2>

<p class=whitemb0>This section explains<span style='mso-bidi-font-weight:bold'>
<b>project owners and backers</b></span> of CrowdedRocket projects. This is
what you are agreeing to when you create or back a CrowdedRocket project. </p>

<p>CrowdedRocket provides a funding platform for startup company projects. When
a project owner posts a project on CrowdedRocket, they are inviting other
people to form a contract with them. Anyone who backs a project is accepting
the project owner’s offer. </p>

<p>CrowdedRocket is not a part of this contract — the contract is a direct
legal agreement between creators and their backers. Here are the terms that
govern that agreement: </p>

<p>When a project is successfully funded, <b>the creator must complete the
project and fulfill each reward</b>. Once a creator has done so, they’ve
satisfied their obligation to their backers. </p>

<p>Throughout the process, creators owe their backers a high standard of
effort, honest communication, and a dedication to bringing the project to life.
At the same time, backers must understand that when they back a project,
they’re helping to create something new — not ordering something that already
exists. There may be changes or delays, and there’s a chance something could
happen that prevents the creator from being able to finish the project as
promised. </p>

<p>If a creator is unable to complete their project and fulfill rewards,
they’ve failed to live up to the basic obligations of this agreement. To right
this, they must make every reasonable effort to find another way of bringing
the project to the best possible conclusion for backers. A creator in this
position has only remedied the situation and met their obligations to backers
if: </p>

<ul type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;
     mso-list:l6 level1 lfo3;tab-stops:list .5in'>they post an update that
     explains what work has been done, how funds were used, and what prevents
     them from finishing the project as planned;</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;
     mso-list:l6 level1 lfo3;tab-stops:list .5in'>they work diligently and in
     good faith to bring the project to the best possible conclusion in a
     timeframe that’s communicated to backers;</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;
     mso-list:l6 level1 lfo3;tab-stops:list .5in'>they’re able to demonstrate
     that they’ve used funds appropriately and made every reasonable effort to
     complete the project as promised;</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;
     mso-list:l6 level1 lfo3;tab-stops:list .5in'>they’ve been honest, and have
     made no material misrepresentations in their communication to backers; and</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;
     mso-list:l6 level1 lfo3;tab-stops:list .5in'><span class=GramE>they</span>
     offer to return any remaining funds to backers who have not received their
     reward (in proportion to the amounts pledged), or else explain how those
     funds will be used to complete the project in some alternate form.</li>
</ul>

<p>The creator is solely responsible for fulfilling the promises made in their
project. If they’re unable to satisfy the terms of this agreement, they may be
subject to legal action by backers. </p>

<h2>5. How Funding Works</h2>

<p>These are the terms that apply when you are <b>backing a project</b>: </p>

<ul type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;
     mso-list:l4 level1 lfo4;tab-stops:list .5in'><b>You are only charged if
     the project reaches its fundraising goal.</b> You’ll provide your payment
     information when you pledge, but you won’t be charged. Your payment will
     only be collected if, at the time of the project’s funding deadline, the
     project has reached its fundraising goal. The exact amount you pledged is
     the amount CrowdedRocket will collect. If the campaign hasn’t reached its
     fundraising goal, you won’t be charged, no funds will be collected, and no
     money will change hands. </li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;
     mso-list:l4 level1 lfo4;tab-stops:list .5in'><b>In some cases we’ll
     reserve the charge on your card.</b> CrowdedRocket and its payment
     partners may authorize or reserve a charge on your credit card (or
     whatever payment method you use) for any amount up to the full pledge, at
     any time between the pledge and the collection of funds. </li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;
     mso-list:l4 level1 lfo4;tab-stops:list .5in'><b>You can change or cancel
     your pledge at any time before the project’s funding deadline (with one
     exception).</b> You can increase, decrease, or cancel your pledge at any
     time during the campaign, with one exception. During the last 24 hours of
     the campaign, you can’t decrease or cancel your pledge without contacting
     customer support first — if that action would drop the project below its
     funding goal. Once the project has been funded, you can only cancel or
     change your pledge by making special arrangements directly with the project
     owner. </li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;
     mso-list:l4 level1 lfo4;tab-stops:list .5in'><b>The Estimated Delivery
     Date is the creator’s <i>estimate.</i></b> The date listed on each reward
     is the project owner’s estimate of when they will provide the reward — not
     a guarantee to fulfill by that date. The schedule may change as the owner works
     on the project. We ask owners to set a date they feel confident they can
     work toward, and communicate with backers about any changes. </li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;
     mso-list:l4 level1 lfo4;tab-stops:list .5in'><b>The project owner may need
     to send you questions about your reward.</b> To deliver rewards, the owner
     might need information from you, like your mailing address or t-shirt
     size. They’ll request that information after the campaign has succeeded.
     To receive the reward, you’ll need to provide the information in a
     reasonable amount of time. </li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;
     mso-list:l4 level1 lfo4;tab-stops:list .5in'><b>CrowdedRocket doesn’t
     offer refunds.</b> Responsibility for finishing a project lies entirely
     with the project owner. CrowdedRocket doesn’t hold funds on owner’s
     behalf, cannot guarantee owner’s work, and does not offer refunds. </li>
</ul>

<p>These are the terms that apply when you are <b>creating a project:</b> </p>

<ul type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;
     mso-list:l0 level1 lfo5;tab-stops:list .5in'><b>Some pledges can’t be
     collected, which might reduce the amount of funding you get.</b> Because
     some payments can’t be collected — for instance, when a backer’s credit
     card expires before funding ends, and they don’t provide updated
     information — we can’t guarantee that the amount of funding you receive
     will be exactly equal to the full amount pledged minus fees. </li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;
     mso-list:l0 level1 lfo5;tab-stops:list .5in'><b>Don’t count your chickens
     before they hatch.</b> Don’t assume you’ll be able to launch your project
     when you want; there could be a reason we’re not able to accept it, or a
     problem that takes time to resolve. Don’t assume you’ll be able to
     immediately collect your funding; there may be a delay between the end of
     a successful campaign and your access to the funds. And don’t take any
     actions in reliance on collecting any of the money pledged until you
     actually have the ability to withdraw it from your account and spend it. </li>
</ul>

from claims, damages, and demands of every kind — known or unknown, suspected
or unsuspected, disclosed or undisclosed — arising out of or in any way related
to such disputes and the Services. All content you access through the Services
is at your own risk. You are solely responsible for any resulting damage or
loss to any party. </p>

<h2>7. Our Fees</h2>

<p class=whitemb0>Fees are only charged on successfully funded projects. We
charge 5%, and there will be processing fees subtracted by our payments
partners. </p>

<p>Creating an account on CrowdedRocket is free. If you create a project that
is successfully funded, we (and our payment partners) collect fees. Our
partners’ fees may vary based on your location but should normally be less than
3% plus some small fixed amount.</p>

<p>If our fees ever change, we will announce that on our Site. Some funds
pledged by backers are collected by payment providers. Each payment provider is
its own company, and CrowdedRocket isn’t responsible for its performance. </p>

<p>You are responsible for paying any additional fees or taxes associated with
your use of CrowdedRocket. </p>

<h2>8. Other Websites</h2>

<p class=whitemb0>If you follow a link to another website, what happens there
is between you and them — not us. </p>

<p>CrowdedRocket may contain links to other websites. (For instance, project
pages, user profiles, and comments may link to other sites.) When you access
third-party websites, you do so at your own risk. We don’t control or endorse
those sites. </p>

<p>CrowdedRocket partners with other companies (such as PayPal) for payment
processing. When you back or create a project, you are also agreeing to the
payment processor’s terms of service. </p>

<h2>9. Your Intellectual Property</h2>

<p class=whitemb0>We do not own what you post on CrowdedRocket. But when you
post it, you are giving us permission to use or copy it however we need in
order to run the site. You are responsible for the content you post, and you
are vouching to us that it is okay to use. </p>

<p>CrowdedRocket does need certain licenses from you in order to perform our
Services. When you submit a project for review, or launch a project, you agree
to these terms: </p>

<h2>10. CrowdedRocket’s Intellectual Property</h2>

<p class=whitemb0>You cannot use CrowdedRocket content for anything commercial
without getting permission first. </p>

<p>CrowdedRocket’s Services are legally protected in various ways, including
copyrights, trademarks, service marks, patents, trade secrets, and other rights
and laws. You agree to respect all copyright and other legal notices,
information, and restrictions contained in any content accessed through the
Site. You also agree not to change, translate, or otherwise create derivative
works of the Service. </p>

<p>CrowdedRocket grants you a license to reproduce content from the Services
for personal use only. This license covers both CrowdedRocket’s own protected content
and user-generated content on the Site. (This license is worldwide,
non-exclusive, non-sublicensable, and non-transferable.) If you want to use,
reproduce, modify, distribute, or store any of this content for a commercial
purpose, you need prior written permission from CrowdedRocket or the relevant
copyright holder. A “commercial purpose” means you intend to use, sell,
license, rent, or otherwise exploit content for commercial use, in any way. </p>

<h2>11. How We Deal with Copyright Issues</h2>

<p>The Digital Millennium Copyright Act lays out a system of legal requirements
for dealing with allegations of copyright infringement. CrowdedRocket complies
with the DMCA, and we will respond to notices of alleged infringement if they
comply with the law and the requirements set forth in our Copyright Policy. We
reserve the right to delete or disable content alleged to be infringing, and to
terminate accounts for repeat infringers. (We do this when appropriate and at
our sole discretion.) </p>

<h2>12. Deleting Your Account</h2>

<p class=whitemb0>You can delete your account at any time. Deleting your
account will not make content you have already posted go away. </p>

<p>You can terminate your account at any time. All provisions of this agreement
survive termination of an account, including our rights regarding any content
you’ve already submitted to the Site. (For instance, if you’ve launched a
project, deleting your account will not remove the project from the Site.) </p>

<h2>13. Our Rights </h2>

<p>CrowdedRocket reserves these rights: </p>

<ul type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;

 <li class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;
     mso-list:l5 level1 lfo7;tab-stops:list .5in'>We have the right to decide
     who is eligible to use CrowdedRocket. We can cancel accounts or decline to
     offer our Services. We can change our eligibility criteria at any time. If
     these things are prohibited by law where you live, then we revoke your
     right to use CrowdedRocket in that jurisdiction.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;
     mso-list:l5 level1 lfo7;tab-stops:list .5in'>We have the right to cancel

actions, and it is our policy not to comment on the reasons for any such
action. </p>
